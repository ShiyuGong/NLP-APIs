# NLP-APIs
Google Cloud Natural Language and Amazon Comprehend API are utilized to do sentiment analysis for Yelp Review dataset.

## Overview 
Sentiment analysis is a subfield of NLP and could be applied systematically to identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. In this project, I would use the following two Cloud resources to did sentiment analysis for Yelp Review dataset.

*	Google Cloud Natural Language API
*	Amazon Comprehend API

## Technique

Firstly, the Yelp review dataset collected from Kaggle contains 10K records of Yelp reviews. Each of them has the stars (1-5) and text review provided by customers. The chart below gives us a first look on how the data spread. We can see that the rating tends to be relatively positive (68% of the ratings > = 4), which may be due to the fact that unhappy customers tend to just leave instead of making efforts to rate. Examples of reviews with low ratings and high ratings are as follows.
